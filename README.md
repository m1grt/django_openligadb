## Installation

Project is based on python 2.7 with Django 1.11.

You can setup and run it in a virtual environment.

Linux:

Since i am on Arch linux where python3 is a system-default, i'll be using python2 and pip2 instead of python and pip respectively.


Ok let's begin....

```sh
git clone https://github.com/m1grt/django_openligadb.git
```

Go to the project directory.
```sh
cd django_openligadb
```

Initiate the command
```sh
pip2 install -r requirements.txt
```

When done, run the project.
```sh
cd openligadb
```

```sh
python2 manage.py runserver
```
Open 127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

That's it.

## Usage example

Nothing to say about how to use it :)
